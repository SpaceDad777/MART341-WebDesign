<li>The Owl House is the sister show to Amphibia and was originally scheduled to air alongside it in 2019, before the former was delayed to 2020.</li>

<li>Both of the series share two of the same animation studios: Rough Draft Korea & Sunmin Image Pictures.</li>
<li>Both series share a similar premise of a teenage female protagonist (Luz/Anne) who gets transported from Earth to a mythical place and is taken in by a family while staying in the world they're in.</li>
<li>Dana Terrace originally considered The Owl House taking place in the afterlife after Luz had died.</li>
<li>Dana Terrace was greatly influenced by Hieronymus Bosch's for the style of the show, and named Boscha and Principal Bump after him.</li>
<li>The series was also influenced by Pokemon Red, a game Terrace's father, Thomas Terrace, an attorney in Hamden, Connecticut, gave her before he died in a car accident when she was age 11.</li>
<li>The design for Luz's palisman, Stringbean, was partially inspired by the series' logo. This is due to the fact that, when the logo is turned upside-down, the 'L' in owl and 'S' in house form a silhouette which resembles a snake-like palisman staff.</li>
<li>After the premiere of the series finale, "Watching and Dreaming", a final rerun of the special the following day marked the end of regular reruns on Disney Channel. The series continued to regularly air on Disney XD until August 18, 2023 with a final rerun of "Clouds on the Horizon", after which it became exclusive to transactional video on demand services and Disney+, although reruns aired on Friday nights in October later that year.</li>
