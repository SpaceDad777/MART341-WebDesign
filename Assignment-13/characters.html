    <h1>Luz Noceda</h1>
    Luz Noceda is the protagonist of The Owl House. She is an eager, teenage Afro-Latina human who accidentally stumbles upon a portal to the Boiling Isles. In order to prove herself as a witch, Luz begins learning magic under Eda's guidance, despite not having any inherent magical abilities of her own.

    <h1>Eda Clawthorne</h1>
    Edalyn "Eda" Clawthorne is the deuteragonist of The Owl House. She ran away from home as a teen after being cursed by her older sister Lilith, a curse which causes her to turn into the owl beast. Eda eventually becomes the most-wanted criminal and the most powerful wild witch on the Boiling Isles until her curse ended up entirely incapacitating her magical ability. During the Day of Unity, whilst attempting to save King from The Collector, she lost control of her curse and attacked, resulting in The Collector holding her captive in the Archive House.

    <h1>Lilith Clawthorne</h1>
    Lilith is Eda's older sister and the disgraced former leader and lead historical scholar of the Emperor's Coven. She was living with her parents, trying to make up for lost time and to develop a cure for Eda and Lilith's curse, along with getting a job in the interim until the Day of Unity, where she was captured by the Collector.

    <h1>King</h1>
    King Clawthorne is the tritagonist of The Owl House. He is a young Titan who is Eda's sidekick, and later adoptive son. Initially, he sought to restore his supposed title and glory as the "King of Demons", before he switched to trying to discover his family and reunite with them. However, it is later discovered that he is actually the last of the Titans, and the son of The Titan, whose remains form the Boiling Isles.This revelation gives King a new outlook on life, and after reflecting on himself, he comes to accept his identity, but doesn't let it define him. King's current goal is to protect those he cares about, namely from Emperor Belos and The Collector, the latter of whom aspires to acquire King's friendship by any means necessary.

    <h1>Amity Blight </h1>
    Amity Blight is a major supporting character of The Owl House. She is a prodigious young witch who attends Hexside School of Magic and Demonics. Although initially depicted as an antagonist, after bonding with Luz, Amity reforms herself and reassesses her outlook on life, gaining the courage to stand up to her parents, regain her friendship with Willow, and become close friends with Luz, eventually becoming her girlfriend. She is the youngest child of the divorced Alador and Odalia Blight and the younger sister of Edric and Emira Blight.

    <h1>Willow Park</h1>
    Willow Park is a major supporting character of The Owl House. She is friends with Luz, Gus, and Amity and attends Hexside alongside them. She was initially part of the abomination track, but has since been moved to the plant track. Willow is naturally very gifted at plant magic, but since she was forced into the abomination track which she proved far less adept with, many at Hexside assumed she was incompetent. This led to years of self-doubt that she has made great strides in overcoming. Following the Day of Unity and the unleashing of the Collector, she was stranded in the Human Realm for months and forced to take shelter at the Noceda residence. She and her friends later returned to the Demon Realm and the Boiling Isles.

    <h1>Gus Porter</h1>
    Augustus "Gus" Porter is a major supporting character of The Owl House. He is friends with Luz, Willow, and Amity, who attend Hexside School of Magic and Demonics with him. Following the Day of Unity and the unleashing of the Collector, Gus was stranded in the Human Realm with his friends and was forced to take shelter at the Noceda residence. At the end of "Thanks to Them", he along with Luz, Amity, Willow, Hunter, and Camila Noceda returned to the Demon Realm.
    
    <h1>Hunter</h1>
    Hunter, formerly known as the Golden Guard, is a major character in The Owl House, initially depicted as an antagonist. He was the right-hand man of Emperor Belos and the former head of the Emperor's Coven. Hunter was presumed to be the nephew of Belos and, as such, was dedicated to his cause of ending all wild magic in the realm, but in reality, he is the latest version of the Golden Guard grimwalkers created by Belos to serve him faithfully in his mad quest. After his promotion to head of the Emperor's Coven, the Golden Guard acts as the main enforcer for Emperor Belos and antagonist to the residents of the Owl House. However, a chance encounter with Luz Noceda, and the meeting of a mysterious palisman named Flapjack who chooses Hunter as his partner, gives Hunter a new perspective and a glimpse of life outside the Emperor's Coven. This soon culminates with Hunter learning the truth of his origins. Upon this discovery, and realizing he can never return to his lifelong home, he abandons Belos and the Emperor's Coven and retreats to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics to evade the emperor's reach. There, he finds acquaintances in Hexside's students, and after coming to terms with his identity, Hunter makes it his goal to help them stand against Belos' plan to wipe out the Demon Realm. Following the events of the Day of Unity and the unleashing of the Collector, Hunter, Luz, Willow, Gus and Amity are stranded in the Human Realm and spend the months working to return to the Demon Realm. Unbeknownst to them, a remnant of Belos follows Hunter to the Human Realm and ends up possessing him, nearly killing his friends and Flapjack in the process. This gives Hunter the strength to finally stand up to his uncle, and he sacrifices himself in an attempt to defeat him once and for all. However, Hunter is saved when Flapjack sacrifices himself to revive him. Belos, weakened but not dead, returns to the Demon Realm, and Hunter and his friends follow closely behind, vowing to honor his fallen palisman. After the group escape capture by the Collector, Hunter helps evacuate the trapped residents from the Isles' destruction. Following Belos' final demise, Hunter chooses to remain on the Isles and work to rebuild society. Four years later, Hunter has become an accomplished palisman carver and bonded to a new palisman, a blue jay named Waffle. He remains close to his friends and commemorates Flapjack, whom he builds a memorial for.
