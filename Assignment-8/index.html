    <h1><u>Lyrics</u></h1>
    <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are<br />
        We're motivated by the scars that we're made of<br />
        These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are<br />
        We take our places in the dark<br />
        And turn our hearts to the stars<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Hear me from the bottom<br />
        Forged in regret, I'm the silversmith<br />
        Doomsday, you had it coming<br />
        Marching the streets with an iron fist<br />
        Obey no more in silence<br />
        The steel in our hearts will be monuments<br />
        Today, they'll hear the violence<br />
        We'll rise from the dark like Lazarus<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are<br />
        We're motivated by the scars that we're made of<br />
        These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are<br />
        We take our places in the dark<br />
        And turn our hearts to the stars<br />
    </p>
    <p>The ending won't be forgotten<br />
        It's written in the stars and the hieroglyphs<br />
        Sending the lionhearted<br />
        The stones break bones, but we're venomous<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are<br />
        We're motivated by the scars that we're made of<br />
        These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are<br />
        We take our places in the dark<br />
        And turn our hearts to the stars <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Calling, calling, we've come out to play<br />
        Show me, show me a new way<br />
        Slowly, slowly, they've led you astray<br />
        Away we go now into the fray<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are<br />
        We're motivated by the scars that we're made of<br />
        These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are<br />
        We take our places in the dark<br />
        And turn our hearts to the stars<br />
    </p>
