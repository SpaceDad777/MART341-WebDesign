# It is almost spooky time!
## Heading 2

Halloween is one of my few favorite holidays of the year. Dressing up, hanging out with friends, getting candy. We can't forget about scary movies. What I love the most is going to a pumpkin patch with my boyfriend and my family, we create fun memories while we are there. Me and my boyfriend love scaring the children when we are walking through the haunted forest/house. 

These simple lines with a few words can be considered a paragraph.
